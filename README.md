# About

This is a sample go app demonstrating how to connect to a mysql database in docker-compose environment.

# Quickstart
The example requires docker and make to be installed.
To build and run the app do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yariksheptykin/go-mysql-example.git
cd go-mysql-example
make
```

The go app simply outputs the number of rows in the test mysql table and exits.
